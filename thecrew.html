  <h1>In a lot of ways, we haven't even left the 90s</h1>
  <p>The 2 Live Crew picked up some of its members later on, but the two originals are still with us.</p>

    <h2>John</h2>
    <i></i>
    <p>A Chicago transplant, John and fellow co-founder Skippy met one fateful day at the University of Minnesota. At the time, neither of them knew the importance of the bond being formed. Having worked in fantasy roleplaying game publishing for several years, John is now enjoying unemployment while his girlfriend pays the rent, like any good Millennial.</p>

    <h2>Skippy</h2>
    <i>Nobody messes with Star Island!</i>
    <p>The second original member of 2 Live Crew. Skippy enjoys filming trash talk videos to challenge other members of the crew. Having only recently come back from living abroad for over half of the past decade, Skippy is enjoying unemployment at his parents' palatial estate, like any good Millennial.</p>

    <h2>Sam</h2>
    <i>I'll spatchcock anything once.</i>
    <p>When Sam heard that 2 Live Crew was opening up its membership, he jumped. The third member of the crew, he helped bridge the time zone gap between Shanghai and Chicago. Having only just finished chemotherapy to squash a bit of cancer, Sam is enjoying unemployment at his brother's house, like any good Millennial.</p>

    <h2>Tyler</h2>
    <p>The last member to join the crew full time, Tyler has proven his mettle on more than one occasion. Although most of the games 2 Live Crew specialize in were new to Tyler, he now frequently sits at the top of the roster. Tyler is also the only employed member of 2 Live Crew.</p>
