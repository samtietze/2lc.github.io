  <h1>Slow-paced, Action-Packed</h1>
  <p>The 2LC specialize in games that take at least eight hours to get into. Most of the games we play span several sessions, and it's usually good to dedicate four hours whenever the crew gets together. However, on occasion we get down with games that are short and quick!</p>
  <ul>
    <li><h2>Civ VI</h2></li>
      <p>This dynamic turn-based strategy game involves either a free-for-all where each player builds up their strength before skirmishing with the others. Different win conditions exist that allow snakes in the grass to come out on top.</p>

    <li><h2>Stellaris</h2></li>
      <p>The clock always moves in this epic strategy game. Each player creates a spacefaring race of aliens before exploring their solar systems and those nearby while slowly expanding their empire and colonizing nearby systems. This game takes so long and is so difficult that the Crew almost always forms a friendly alliance against the AI.</p>

    <li><h2>Starcraft II</h2></li>
      <p>Players assume the roles of one of three available races and build their armies to pit against one another. A short and quick match that typically involves everyone teaming up against John since he's the best at this game.</p>
    <li><h2>Hammerwatch</h2></li>
      <p>A new game introduced to the Crew by Tyler, each player assumes archetypal roles of fantasy characters: fighter, paladin, thief, wizard, ranger, warlock, and sorceror. A quick favorite of the crew, thanks to its community maps.</p>
